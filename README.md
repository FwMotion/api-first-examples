# api-first-examples

This repository will serve as a collection of examples to demonstrate
development of services and clients using an API-first
(or contract-first) approach. Each of these examples will supplement a
corresponding blog article that discusses the techniques within.

The planned articles will include:

 - Building services with Apache Camel
 - Building clients with Apache Camel
 - Building services with Spring Boot
 - Building clients with Spring Boot

Longer term, articles that involve Quarkus may also be included.
